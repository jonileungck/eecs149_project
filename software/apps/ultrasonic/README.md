Ultrasonic Receiver  
==============

Wait for an ultrasonic detector interrupt, record the time that the interrupt happens, then log the time on terminal.  
Each time an interrupt happens, the corresponding LED also lights up for the duration that sensor is disabled (35ms)  

Detection range is severely reduced when the reflector cone is installed:  

Range when reflector on both receiver and transmitter: 1m  
Range when reflector on receiver only: 2m  
Range when no reflector: >4m
